# github-tools

## Overview

This repository contains tools for working with GitHub repositories from
the command line. For now there is just one (`gh-pr-query`).

## Installation

This script and its necessary dependencies can be installed similarly to
other python tools, using `pip install`. It is not yet on PyPI, but it
can be installed directly from this GitHub repository with:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ESMCI/github-tools.git@master
```

## Tools contained here

### gh-pr-query

Tool for querying GitHub pull requests

To show all of the outstanding todo items in all comments in a pull request
(i.e., all unchecked checkboxes):

    gh-pr-query -r REPO -p PR_NUMBER -t

To show all comments in a pull request:

    gh-pr-query -r REPO -p PR_NUMBER -s

Output is sorted by date; for todos, all required todos are listed
before optional todos. (Optional todos are denoted by starting a todo
item with '[optional]', '(optional)', or 'optional:', lowercase or
uppercase.)

For either usage, output can be filtered on username - only showing
comments made by the given username - with the `-u` or
`--filter-username` option.

For more detailed help, run

    gh-pr-query -h

#### Recommended workflow

See [the
wiki](https://github.com/ESMCI/github-tools/wiki/Recommended-pull-request-workflow-with-gh-pr-query)
for the recommended workflow in order to most effectively leverage this
tool's `--todo` option.

## Providing a personal access token

The tools here optionally allow you to set a GitHub personal access
token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This is a personal,
random string generated by GitHub, which is NOT the same as your GitHub
password. For tools that only do read operations on public repositories,
an access token is not required. However, GitHub rate-limits fetches via
the API, and the limit is very small if you do not provide an access
token. So, in order to do more than a few queries per hour, you will
likely need to set up and provide a personal access token.

[GitHub's help
guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
provides instructions for creating a personal access token. If you only
need read access to public repositories, then you do not need to check
any of the boxes when setting up your access token.

You only need to create a personal access token once, but once you do,
you will need to save it somewhere, such as in a password manager.

You can then either set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your shell's environment, or
specify it just for the given command - e.g.,:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=abc123 gh-pr-query ...
```

## Testing the code

If you make changes the code, you should run the tests in the `tests`
subdirectory. See the README file in that directory for details.
